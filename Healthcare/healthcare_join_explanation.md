# SQL JOINs in Healthcare

### INNER JOIN
Use to find patients who have appointments (matched data only).

### LEFT JOIN
Use to get a list of all patients, including those without appointments. Useful for patient follow-ups.

### RIGHT JOIN
Use when focusing on appointments, even if they don't link to a patient (e.g., test data or errors).

### FULL JOIN
Combine both datasets fully â€“ useful in auditing and cross-checking records.
